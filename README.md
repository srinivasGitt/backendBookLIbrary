Sure, here's a template for a README file for your backend API:

# Backend API

## Overview
This is a backend API built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a resource.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd backend-api`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage
### Starting the Server
To start the server, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will run on port 3001 by default.

### Restarting the Server
If you make changes to the code and want to restart the server, you can use nodemon. Run the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the server using nodemon, which automatically restarts the server whenever changes are detected in the code.

### Running Tests
The project includes Jest test cases. To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test
```
This will execute all test cases and display the results.
